I wrote this during Covid, when our local theatre stopped putting spacing between seats. My wife was _very_ sick, and had a compromised immune system for several months, but we wanted to go to some movies  
So, this was born  

The basic idea is you reserve say seats `H2-H5` for a movie, and enter the Fandango information for your movies as well as your seats  
This will find that movie and "reserve" buffer seats around your selection, but continually viewing the seats in Fandango, which provides a 7-10 minute window  

I am experiemtend with usign Atom as well  


I do not actively use this any more, but it is an interesting webcrawler using NodeJS, and I intend to make it more reliable to learn good webcrawling logic
